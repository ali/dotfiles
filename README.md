# Ali's Dotfiles

A lot of these are copied from [Thoughtbot's dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles). In order to discourage myself from blindly using their dotfiles, I'm not forking their repo as per their README.

Right now I'm just trying to merge Thoughtbot's dotfiles with my own previous dotfiles.
